# Soil smart
Predict soil fertility and give comprehensive agricultural knowledge to farmers based on their soil and questions

## Introduction
This project leverages the power of Generative AI to enhance soil analysis. By using the Replicate with Llama 2-13b model, coupled with a small image analysis network implemented using OpenCV, SoilSmart Image Analysis aims to provide valuable insights into soil quality and composition.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

## Purpose
SoilSmart Image Analysis serves the purpose of assisting agricultural and environmental experts in analyzing soil samples. By employing image analysis techniques and Generative AI, it offers the following benefits:

Soil Quality Assessment: The project can assess soil quality based on image analysis, helping farmers and environmentalists make informed decisions about soil treatment and conservation.

Composition Analysis: It can provide insights into the composition of soil, including the presence of minerals, organic matter, and other vital components.

Predictive Insights: The Generative AI model, Replicate with Llama 2-13b, aids in making predictions about future soil conditions based on historical data and current observations.

## Generative AI Choice
The choice of using the Replicate with Llama 2-13b Generative AI model was driven by its proven ability to generate high-quality and contextually relevant data. In the context of this project, it enables us to generate valuable insights from soil images, aiding in more accurate soil analysis and predictions.
